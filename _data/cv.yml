- title: Academic Interests
  type: nested_list
  contents:
    - title: Computational Complexity and Physics
      items:
        - Are there systems in physics which are simply too complex to solve? If so, how do we classify them? What are their properties?
        - What can the physics of these systems tell us about quantum computers are computer science more generally?
    - title: Applying Classical Machine Learning to Quantum Systems
      items:
        - Classical shadows have allowed us to access quantum systems with classical data. How can we apply these methods to learn quantum systems efficiently?
        - When do these techniques ``dequantise'' current quantum machine learning techniques?
        - Can we use classical machine learning to speed-up quantum algorithms?
     - title: Algorithms for Quantum Simulation
      items:
        - Quantum simulation is among the most promising applications for a speedup using a quantu computer. But which algorithms are likely to most effective?
        - Can we leverage asymptotical poor quantum algorithms into something better using classical machine learning and post-processing? 
        - When applying these algorithms, how can we best leverage the structure of the problem to reduce resource costs?
