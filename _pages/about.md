I'm a postdoc in quantum computing at QuICS, University of Maryland where I mostly work with Andrew Childs and Yi-Kai Liu. Before, I was a PhD student with Toby Cubitt at UCL.

My research covers a bunch of topics, including quantum algorithms for simulation, machine learning, and the intersection between quantum information and many-body quantum physics.

I love results showing that there's stuff we can't know about the universe: even if we have a first principles description of physics, it turns out there's stuff which is uncomputable -- we can't derive it's behaviour from first principles.
